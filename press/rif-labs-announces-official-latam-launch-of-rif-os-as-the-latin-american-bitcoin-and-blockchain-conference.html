                     <p><i>BitGive and OAK partner with RIF Labs to leverage RSK Smart Contract Technology
                        </i>
                     </p>
                     <p>RIF Labs, the purpose-driven organization led by RSK Labs’s founding team and other top executives, is announcing the official Latin American launch of RIF OS (Root Infrastructure Framework Open Standard) at the Latin America Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference in Santiago, Chile. RIF OS is a suite of open and decentralized protocols that enables faster, easier, and scalable development of distributed blockchain applications (dApps) within a unified environment. </p>
                     <p>RIF OS enables broad interoperability and faster time to deployment, bridging the gap between blockchain technologies and their mass market adoption. RIF OS implementations, combined with the RSK Smart Contract Network (RSKSmart), will bring the ‘Internet of Value’ and its potential to enable financial equality and prosperity around the world a step closer to realization. RIF Labs chose to build its implementations of the RIF OS Protocols on top of the RSK Smart Contract Network because of its unique position as the first open-source smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network.</p>
                     <p>Diego Gutierrez-Zaldivar, CEO of RIF Labs, said: “We’re delighted to present the new RIF OS platform to our loyal Latin American community. The Latin American Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference brings together some of the biggest and brightest stars in the blockchain realm, and we’re excited to give this community an inside look at our newly launched product and encourage them to engage with it.”</p>
                     <p>In a related announcement, BitGive, the first Bitcoin 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and OAK Node, the “app store” for crypto nodes, have partnered with RIF Labs to leverage the RSK Smart Contract Network to build their platforms. The organizations will be joining the RIF Labs team at the Latin America Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference, and will give demos of their respective technology onsite.</p>
                     <p>OAK is a cross-platform solution that makes it possible for anyone to host any cryptocurrency node in less than 15 seconds – no coding required. Through the partnership with RIF Labs, developers will be given unprecedented tools to speed up the development of nodes, and provided greater incentives to host nodes. In addition, BitGive is using RSK Smart Contract Technology for the development of their Bitcoin donation platform, GiveTrack. The platform offers unprecedented transparency in the donation process, giving donors the ability to trace transactions on a public platform in real time.</p>
                     <p>Nina Wieczorek, CEO of OAK Node, said: “We’re thrilled to partner with the inspiring team behind RSK to support the growth of their network. RSK’s smart contract protocol is a major driver of the value economy, and we’re bringing powerful and simple developer tools to RSK and RIF OS. OAK will help grow their distributed infrastructure, hosted by real users, and we can’t wait to see what their community builds.”</p>
                     <p>Connie Gallippi, Founder and Executive Director of BitGive, added: “We are very excited and quite honored to roll out one of the first products using RSK technology on the main net. We have a long-standing and great working relationship with RSK and the team. BitGive and RSK are mission aligned, and both organizations are passionate about the possibilities of Bitcoin and blockchain and committed to empowering people through leveraging this innovative technology.”</p>
