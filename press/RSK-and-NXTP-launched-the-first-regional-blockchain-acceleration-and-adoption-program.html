                     <p><i>RSK and NXTP launched the first regional blockchain acceleration and adoption program aimed at start-ups and companies interested in developing their blockchain products, or migrating them from “off-chain” to “on-chain”. </i></p>
                     <p>On top of developing their capabilities with RSK’S stack technology benefits,  <span class="green">they may be able to receive up to $100,000 in investments</span> in order to implement their growth for the duration of the acceleration program.</p>
                     <p>The search will focus on Latin American start-ups at varying degrees of maturity and which are developing innovative products or services that can be optimized by adopting RSK’S blockchain stack technologies.</p>
                     <p>Also, companies that are in the process of adopting blockchain technologies and that are looking to widen and strengthen their value proposition by partnering with RSK will be summoned.</p>
                     <p class="green">RSK remarks</p>
                     <p>Rubén Altman, Head of Adoption at IOV Labs commented: “We are very happy to launch this first acceleration program together with NXTP. This first program, and those in coming years, will be a key instrument in helping Latin American start-ups with the highest potential make the most of blockchain advantages in their businesses. NXTP’S expertise in business development, our technical and business know-how together with financial support, are key tools to assure a successful implementation in which the technological value quickly reaches businesses and end users”.</p>
                     <p class="green">NXTP remarks</p>
                     <p>Marta Cruz, Managing Partner at NXTP, said: "The launch of RSK’S blockchain adoption and acceleration program is great news for all of Latin America. This program is one of a kind; it will empower the start-ups ecosystem, companies and corporations in the entire region to adopt one of the most disruptive technologies in recent years. We are very happy to continue to work closely with RSK. We were also early investors and we consider it to be one of the most disruptive companies in this industry, at a global level".</p>
                     <p>The acceleration and adoption program has a strategy called “from Off-chain to On-Chain” that is based on helping those companies having an NXTP ecosystem based technology to start getting integrated into the blockchain platform in order to improve and optimize their scaling processes and/or provide more transparent innovation to their clients. 
                     </p>
                     <p>The program is jointly operated by RSK, the first smart contracts platform guaranteed by the Bitcoin network, together with NXTP Blockchain, the NXTP branch which is focused on developing this technology in Latin America.</p>
