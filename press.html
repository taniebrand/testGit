Both teams share a unified vision of an open and encrypted data storage and streaming system, underscored by a new incentive model that reimburses data providers for retrieving popular content. As part of the collaboration, they are also jointly developing the first implementation of the concept under RIF Storage services — which will pave the way for a wide array of innovation related to the blockchain storage industry.

                     Bitcoin and blockchain scalability is one of the most important issues being discussed throughout the ecosystem these days. While the RSK Network added smart contract capabilities and onchain scaling improvements on top of the Bitcoin network, it is not enough to achieve transaction processing levels on par with those offered by major payment processors around the world. On top of this, onchain scaling impacts the future as every record saved on the blockchain needs to be saved forever.

                     RIF Labs, owner of RSK Labs, and Monday Capital, announced the launch of the first Blockchain Innovation and Development Studio for Bitcoin, RSK and RIF OS in San Francisco and a global Ecosystem Fund. The Studio will create new developer tools that will streamline the integration of decentralized infrastructure. It will be a space of experimentation that facilitates the creation of next-generation blockchain solutions in partnership with startups and corporations in order to identify real-world problems that blockchain-based products and services can solve.

                     RIF Labs has announced that developers can now launch a RSK Smart Mainnet node on Microsoft’s Azure BaaS offering, becoming one of the few public blockchains supported by Microsoft’s Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) marketplace. The integration provides a simplified process for setting up an environment that facilitates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and services supported by the Bitcoin blockchain. This enables users to deploy and configure an RSK blockchain network in minutes, instead of setting up local servers and manually installing and maintaining the nodes. Now both non-blockchain and blockchain developers can learn and experiment at a low-cost  and easily on the RSK network.

                     RIF Labs, the purpose-driven organization led by RSK Labs’s founding team and other top executives, has announced that the RSK blockchain has become the most secure smart contract platform in the world, and second most secure blockchain behinnd the Bitcoin blockchain. As reported by the Crypto51 website, which aggregates data from Mine the Coin, CoinMarketCap, and NiceHash, the cost to execute a 51% attack on Bitcoin costs US$ 244,853. By surpassing 45% of the hashing power of the Bitcoin network, an attack on the RSK Smart Contract Network would cost approximately US$ 112,000 per hour. This makes RSK one of the most secure and reliable platforms for developers to build their dApps, and proves that merge-mining can succeed in securing Bitcoin sidechains.
